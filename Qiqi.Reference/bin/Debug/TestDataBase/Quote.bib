As long as people have settled in the Alps, they had to deal with avalanche hazard. Structural mitigation measures, protection forests, and land-use planning reduced the hazard and the risk in the past decades and contributed thereby to the development of mountain regions. In many countries, decisions on dealing with the consequences of avalanches are increasingly based on the assessment of risks and not only on the reduction of hazard. In the first part of this chapter, we present different elements of an integrative risk management of avalanches with a focus on Switzerland. In the second part, we present an example of how this concept can be applied to handle the avalanche risk in the City of Juneau, Alaska. "

The authors discuss a model for capturing decisions in terms of the outcomes and ties them to three broad categories: strategic, operational, and incident management. Lastly, the risk management system model is introduced that ties risk and risk management together with a feedback loop. In addition, the difference between intended versus actual is discussed in the model. "

Using 39 peer-reviewed academic English-language journals as the basis of our analysis, we conducted both a content analysis and a bibliometric analysis on the characteristics of the research: disciplinarity, knowledge, place and scale, stakeholder involvement, and policy applications as well as the integration across these traits. While integrated disaster risk research has made great strides over the past 15 years, much of it is still discipline or multi-discipline centric and largely produced by North American and European scholars. The co-production of knowledge is limited and implementation gaps between research and practice persist. "

Risk averse farmers are less willing to take on activities and investments that have higher expected outcomes, but carry with them risks of failure. This research is an attempt to quantify farmers’ perceptions of catastrophic risks, their risk attitude and to assess the effect of farm and farm household characteristics, farmers’ access to information and credit sources on their risk perceptions and risk attitude. Equally Likely Certainty Equivalent approach is used to elicit farmers’ attitude towards risk and risk matrix is used to rank farmers’ perception of four calamitous risk sources including floods, heavy rains, pest and diseases and droughts. The results revealed that majority of the farmers are risk averse in nature and consider floods, heavy rains and pest and diseases to be potential threats to their farms enterprise. Age and education of the household head, off-farm monthly income of the household, land ownership status and farmer’ access to informal credit sources significantly affect farmers’ attitude towards risk. The effects of socio-economic and demographic factors on farmers’ risk perceptions are insignificant while access to formal information and informal credit sources adds to the risk perceptions of farmers. The study provides useful insights for farmers, agricultural policy makers, extension services, researchers and agricultural insurance sector. Understanding farmers’ risk attitude and risk perceptions have implications for policy makers and research institutions in providing farmers with accurate information, formulating sophisticated risk management tools and providing agricultural credit and extension services.

Analysing global volcanic risk can provide a better understanding of the spatial pattern and hot spots of volcanic risk. This paper quantitatively maps the fatality risk of volcano on a global scale by calculating the annual eruption frequency of volcanoes of each Volcanic Explosivity Index (VEI) and building the global vulnerability curve of fatality. This study approved the global volcanic risk assessment method in three aspects: 1) The expected annual eruption frequency of each \{VEI\} scale of each volcano is analysed as hazard; 2) The vulnerability curve is fitted by the historical average fatality of each \{VEI\} provided by National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA). 3) Physical exposure is calculated using global 1×1&#xa0;km resolution population distribution data of 2010 from Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The exposed regions that have a potential fatality risk are calculated according to several former studies by analysing the largest lethal radius of pyroclastic flow, lahar, and tephra. The results are exhibited at grid, national and comparable-geographic level to provide as much information about volcanic risk as possible in different dimensions. The results show that: 1) Global distribution pattern of expected annual fatality risk due to volcanic hazards is consistent with that of hazards, while local distribution of risks is related to distribution of vulnerability and exposure. 2) Most high risk areas are along the plate boundary, especially the Pacific Rim. 3) The top 10% high risk countries are Indonesia, Russia, United States, Papua New Guinea, Japan and Philippines.

However, insured losses were insignificant. Nevertheless, volcanic eruptions might pose an underestimated threat to the insurance industry that requires measures to keep the insurance risk under control. In principle, the same risk evaluation processes apply as for other natural perils, where risk is a function of hazard, the vulnerability of the exposed objects, and the exposed values. Probabilistic computer models have been developed for the proper assessment of risks since the late 1980s, but are in their infancy for volcanic risk. Here, the instruments developed in the insurance industry to evaluate volcanic risk are described as they form the basis for controlling and financing future losses. Due to the variety of volcanic products and the large range of possible event sizes, volcanic risk presents a particular challenge for risk management. Two types of volcanic threats have to be considered: (1) city scenarios of local or regional extent and (2) rare extreme events with global consequences that even require a discussion on insurability as such. An urgent need exists to improve our knowledge in order to reduce the high uncertainty in actual risk evaluation to an acceptable level. For the industry, it is particularly important to achieve full transparency regarding covered and noncovered risks and to define the limits of insurability for megadisasters in a systematic manner. The Global Volcano Model makes a number of efforts in this direction. "

The results confirmed the correlation between the risk management adoption decisions and revealed that adoption of one risk management tool may make it more likely to adopt the other risk management tool at the same time. Moreover, the results also highlighted the role of age and education of the household head, monthly household income, land ownership status and risk averse nature of the farmers on the decisions to adopt diversification and precautionary savings to manage farm risks. The use of both bivariate and multinomial probit approaches provides richer interpretations, better inferences, and more information that may further improve understanding of the risk management decisions of farmers and will help policy maker to better anticipate which farmer will adopt government support risk management tool in the presence of traditional risk management tools.

Informal settlements, or ‘campamento’ (literally meaning campsites in Chile), within these cities were studied and analyzed. The results revealed that while these originally illegal campamentos have gradually been absorbed by urban sprawl and have reached internal consolidation, they continue to maintain their conditions of precariousness and social vulnerability. The campamento settlements are frequently located in areas exposed to natural hazards. They have also been subject to institutional backwardness, or a lack of oversight, with little to no attention being paid to risk reduction. In Iquique, the campamentos located in the northern zone of the city are highly exposed to seismic threats and landslides. They are also close to the port and the tax free zone (ZOFRI). In the case of Puerto Montt, the most vulnerable areas of the campamentos are the coastline areas to the west and east of the city, which are subject to landslides and flooding. The campamento settlements constitute real vulnerability hotspots for their residents, as they are high risk zones within the cities, characterized by high levels of precariousness. In general, they have not been considered in the urban improvement measures, even though they have been part of each city’s main urban area for several decades now. "

This study examined the effects of framing of earthquake risk on risk perception. Five frames described logically identical but semantically different statements describing the earthquake risk to the population of a hypothetical city. The frames varied frequencies versus probabilities, the time frame (1600 dead in 500 years, 10% chance of 1600 dead in 50 years, 2 deaths per year) and the sample frame (1.9 deaths per 100,000, 19 per million). Participants rated the five frames according to how risky they seem. The statement that describes the risk in relation to a 50-year time frame and uses a fatality frequency (10% chance of 1600 dead in 50 years) was rated more risky than the other four statements. This finding suggests that risk relating to low frequency hazards should be framed in terms of frequencies of deaths over a life-time. These results clarify which framing has the strongest effect on judgments of earthquake risk and can help agencies responsible for risk management to communicate risk information more effectively. "

The KR-FWK (i.e. from the name of the European project within which it originated) and the \{SERRA\} approach were developed upon preexisting proposals, with three main innovation aims: (1) to include the social capacities of reducing vulnerability and risk, (2) to provide an operational solution to assess risks, impacts, and the benefits of plausible risk reduction measures, by including a monetary estimation of costs and benefits, and (3) to go beyond the estimation of direct tangible costs. Vulnerability is considered as a result of the interactions between physical (territorial) characteristics and the susceptibility and the capacities of the socioeconomic system to adapt and cope with a specific hazard, expressed as a nondimensional index ranging between 0 and 1. Exposure, is instead assessed in monetary terms, and thus the multiplicative combination of two indices ranging between 0 and 1 (hazard and vulnerability) with a third one (exposure) expressed in monetary terms produces a monetary quantification of risk, which can be used for supporting decisions via cost-benefit analysis. Regarding the third aim of going beyond the estimation of direct tangible damages, operational solutions are proposed to evaluate four possible socioeconomic costs possibly deriving from the adverse consequences of flood, namely direct/indirect and tangible/intangible costs. The proposed methodology aims to be comprehensive with respect to the set of receptors usually considered in the literature of regional risk assessment. The sets of receptors considered are people, economic activities, categorized as (1) buildings; (2) infrastructures; and (3) agriculture and cultural heritage and ecosystems. We show how to apply \{SERRA\} and the KR-FWK in the case of Dhaka/Lower Brahmaputra/Bangladesh, by reusing elaborations already done or in progress and by developing some minimal new work; e.g. to demonstrate indirect/intangible costs.

However, local governments may not have the capacity yet to address this need. Therefore, this inquiry investigates the current status of disaster risk reduction in a local Jordanian municipality to understand the current limitations facing this approach. Such an investigation will help in understanding the challenges facing local governments in non-capital cities of the region. The study provides several recommendations for initiating disaster risk reduction on the local level, stressing that the political culture and governance style in the region creates many obstacles. Further, the limited capability of local governments, the serious social and economic problems, and misleading natural disaster cognition create handicaps should the approach be implemented. The legal opaqueness in identification of jurisdictions and responsibilities compounded by the status quo of high dependency on the central government, in addition to fixation on a para-military approach to disaster management calls for reassessment of disaster management policies and related laws in Jordan.

abstract = "Abstract It is increasingly recognized that a comprehensive understanding of the existing flood system is necessary to effectively manage coastal flood risk. This involves consideration of the social and ecological dimensions in addition to the hydrological aspects that have been the traditional focus of flood analysis. Social aspects are important, as they represent both the reason for flood management and the growth in exposure, as well as providing the context within which any decision will be made. Coastal species and habitats are inherently important for the flood management ecosystem services that they provide for flood management. The flood flow, depth, and extent determine the potential for flood damage. The conceptual model adopted here for coastal risk assessment is based on the Source-Pathway-Receptor-Consequence model, which is a simple linear conceptual model for representing flood systems and processes that lead to a particular flooding consequence. This approach is being used to evaluate how the Sources (waves, tides, storm surge, mean sea level, river discharge, run-off), through the Pathways (including coastal defenses), affect the Receptors (inland system), generating economic, social, and environmental Consequences. Collectively, this more holistic analysis of the flood system can identify likely trends in flood risk and the wide range of potential mitigation options embracing engineering, ecological, or socioeconomic measures, including hybrid combined approaches.

abstract = "Abstract The spatial distribution of future landslide risk is influenced by several dynamic factors related to global change such as variance in distribution of elements at risk or changes in precipitation patterns. The assessment of future spatial distribution of landslide risk is essential for efficient and sustainable risk management and the development of adequate adaptation strategies to global change. The objective of this study is to approximate landslide exposure for the two future periods 2030–2050 and 2050–2100 considering the potential development of land cover and climate change scenarios as an intermediate step within risk analysis. In order to link the future potential developments to current conditions and past changes, an analysis of former land cover changes is performed. This leads to a total analysis period of more than 100 years. The collection of the different datasets is based on various methods such as remote sensing, field mapping and modelling. The study area is the district Waidhofen/Ybbs in Lower Austria. It comprises approximately 130&#xa0;km2; thus a regional assessment is required. Within the study area, a variety of land cover types such as building area, agricultural areas and forests can be observed. The future climate is characterized by generally dry summers and average wet winters. However, the frequency of intense rainfall events increases in summer. The visualisation of these landslide exposure scenarios can significantly contribute to the awareness of eventual problems that need to be faced in the future. Consequently, the results of such analyses might support the improvement of future adaption and management strategies. "

It presents an introduction to the challenges presented by mainstream approaches to the human side of disaster studies, whereby perspectives on environmental hazards and human development meet policy and practice. This is informed by analyzing the influences of extreme environmental events on society, exposure factors, and the nature of emergent systems of response. In this field, people are considered as vulnerable and resilient to disaster impacts, suffering, or prospering in times of climate change, development, societal instability, and governance scenarios that can be unpredictable and out of control. This is in part balanced by hope in the emergence of new-found awareness and capacity, to be able to live with hazards and risks, cope with disaster, and prosper socially and economically. A challenge presented by hazards, risks, and disasters is to achieve the capacity to both anticipate the unexpected and act on the known. A wealth of well-grounded emergent knowledge and experience exists to facilitate this, some of the most enlightening and innovative of which is revealed in the selection of contributions to this volume.

abstract = "Abstract Over the past two decades, decision-making in disaster risk management (DRM) has evolved significantly. This has resulted in a re-focus from a predominantly top-down, ‘command and control’ style of management, to the encouragement of ‘people-centred’ approaches and local participation. In this paper we critically explore this transition, particularly examining the teething problems related to the adoption of people-centred approaches, and especially to the transfer of \{DRM\} responsibility from the agencies in charge to the private citizens. We review traditional top-down approaches against a backdrop of changing circumstances relevant to disaster risk, and present some background to the international push for people-centred approaches, comparing the key characteristics of the two approaches. Using three case studies, we discuss how the personal responsibilities of citizens are weighed against the responsibilities of local authorities. The examples reveal a complex landscape characterised by insufficient resources at the local level, and lack of willingness among public at risk to share responsibility for disaster risk management with authorities. Moreover, local participation can create situations of conflict between public and private interests. If official authorities are to implement the new people-centred approach, they must better understand residents' perspectives and responsibility expectations, become more competent communicators, and be willing to engage in long-term dialogue with communities. This requires the courage to question existing institutional arrangements, and not only devolve power in DRM, but also relinquish responsibility to citizens. Future research must focus particularly on better understanding the benefits and challenges of shared state and civil responsibility in \{DRM\} theory and practice. "
