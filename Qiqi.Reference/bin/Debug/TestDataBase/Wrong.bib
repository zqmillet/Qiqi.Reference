  Abstract                 = {An integrated decision support system is described based on sensor fusion techniques, used for assessing the security of power systems. The integrated decision support system fuses information from various approximated system performance (ASP) models to minimize the risk of making the wrong decision under changing operating conditions. It uses the classification decisions provided by different ASP models together with information about their statistical performance (e.g., probabilities of misclassifications) to synthesize the globally optimal decision in the Bayesian risk sense. This global decision is often superior (and in no case inferior) to the one obtained using any single ASP model. The design of the integrated decision support system is illustrated for detecting static voltage collapse by fusing the security information from a set of existing security indices},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract An airport is the gateway which facilitates access to air transport. As a reaction to very diverse attacks on the air transport system during the last decades a broad range of security measures has been introduced to mitigate possible threats. The challenge to provide a trouble free experience for the passenger and, at the same time, to operate more efficiently calls for a proactive approach. This requires the definition of future requirements that allow an adaptation of the security system. When dealing with uncertainty that future-oriented decisions inevitably display, it is important to gain as much knowledge as possible about a system's general structure. The approach described in this paper systematically documents elements and relationships of the airport security system. It consists of threat scenario elements as well as security measures. The development of a software tool, the so-called Scenario Builder, is described and its application for the identification of possible future threats explained. The presented approach offers intuitive access to the underlying structure of the airport security system. It provides decision makers with a possibility to interact with the system and anticipate effects of threat development, thereby enabling robust, future-oriented decisions. },

  Abstract                 = {As the danger from a terrorist on board a plane continues to plague air travel, it is becoming increasingly clear that the issue of the proper set of security devices at airports is of paramount criticality. While security devices such as metal detectors have been used at airports for years, there is increased divisiveness concerning the right amount and scope of security devices at airports. There are many proponents and many opponents of the latest rage, full-body scanners and enhanced pat-downs, and the refrain of liberty vs. security is often heard. In previous work, we have shown that it is inadvisable to rely on a single supplier. Similarly, one may argue that it is inadvisable to rely on a security system with a single device, the metal detector, even if it is augmented with the now routine identification process of matching a passenger鈥檚 boarding pass and driver鈥檚 license. This paper focuses on the number and ordering of security devices that would be appropriate at an airport. The paper proposes that the decision-making process be modeled using a decision-tree approach. It considers the probability of a terrorist event, the loss caused by such an event, and the cost of having/operating multiple security devices. However, a key advantage is that the 鈥渃osts鈥?are not limited to the monetary costs. The methodology could serve as an aid to airport managers and other officials responsible for airport security, as well as to academics who are analyzing these issues.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Compliance with ever-increasing privacy laws, accounting and banking regulations, and standards is a top priority for most organizations. Information security and systems audits for assessing the effectiveness of \{IT\} controls are important for proving compliance. Information security and systems audits, however, are not mandatory to all organizations. Given the various costs, including opportunity costs, the problem of deciding when to undertake a security audit and the design of managerial incentives becomes an important part of an organization's control process. In view of these considerations, this paper develops an \{IT\} security performance evaluation decision model for whether or not to conduct an \{IT\} security audit. A Bayesian extension investigates the impact of new information regarding the security environment on the decision. Since security managers may act in an opportunistic manner, the model also incorporates agency costs to determine the incentive payments for managers to conduct an audit. Cases in which the agency model suggests that it is optimal not to conduct an \{IT\} security audit are also discussed.},

An analysis of respondents from eight airports in Europe demonstrated that compliance with security rules and protocols was related to two main categories of trust in technology: one oriented to the technology itself and the other to technology as a means of catching offenders. A further multivariate analysis showed that security decisions by each 鈥榯rusting鈥?group tended to reflect its degree of commitment to the organizations' administrative guidelines and the organizations' security attitude. },

Global organizations resort to the use of technological devices to reduce the frequency of a security breach. To minimize the impact of financial losses from security breaches, we advocate the use of cyber-insurance products. This paper proposes models to help firms decide on the utility of cyber-insurance products and to what extent they can use them. In this paper, we propose a Copula-aided Bayesian Belief Network (CBBN) for cyber-vulnerability assessment (C-VA), and expected loss computation. Taking these as an input and using the concepts of collective risk modeling theory, we also compute the premium that a cyber risk insurer can charge to indemnify cyber losses. Further, to assist cyber risk insurers and to effectively design products, we propose a utility based preferential pricing (UBPP) model. \{UBPP\} takes into account risk profiles and wealth of the prospective insured firm before proposing the premium.},

  Abstract                 = {Most efforts to improve cyber security focus primarily on incorporating new technological approaches in products and processes. However, a key element of improvement involves acknowledging the importance of human behavior when designing, building and using cyber security technology. In this survey paper, we describe why incorporating an understanding of human behavior into cyber security products and processes can lead to more effective technology. We present two examples: the first demonstrates how leveraging behavioral science leads to clear improvements, and the other illustrates how behavioral science offers the potential for significant increases in the effectiveness of cyber security. Based on feedback collected from practitioners in preliminary interviews, we narrow our focus to two important behavioral aspects: cognitive load and bias. Next, we identify proven and potential behavioral science findings that have cyber security relevance, not only related to cognitive load and bias but also to heuristics and behavioral science models. We conclude by suggesting several next steps for incorporating behavioral science findings in our technological design, development and use.},

  Abstract                 = {Extant literatures discuss a firm's security issuance implications of heterogeneous beliefs with explicit assumption that short selling is forbidden. However, it is widely accepted that short sale constraints exist when investors are unable to short stock to the extent they desire. This paper presents a model to analyze how heterogeneous beliefs and short sale constraint conditions jointly affect a firm's security issuance decision. The main findings are: i) An increase in heterogeneity in investors' beliefs results in an increased likelihood of equity issuance over debt when public signal is favorable, whereas it results in a reduced likelihood when public signal is modestly adverse. ii) The tightness of short sale constraints has a positive effect on the likelihood of equity issuance only when public signal is highly favorable. These results indicate widely divergent conclusions about the relations between heterogeneous beliefs as well as short sale constraints and security issuance decision. },
