# Qiqi Reference

A software for references management based on `BibTeX`.

## Introduction
The word `BibTeX` stands for a tool and a file format which are used to describe and process lists of references, mostly in conjunction with `LaTeX` documents.

`Qiqi Reference` is a references management software based on `BibTeX`. I develop this reference management software for two purposes.
  
### Learn Visual Basic .NET Development
I developed Visual Basic program from Visual Basic 6.0, and I liked it. Now, Visual Basic is a multi-paradigm, object-oriented programming language, implemented on the .NET Framework.

`Qiqi Reference` is the first large software developed by me with Visual Basic .NET. I believe that with the development, my development capabilities will be improved.

### Make a Better References Management Software
I'm using the reference management software which is called `JabRef`. It is a wonderful, simple, and powerful software. But it has some little drawbacks:

- Can't download full papers.
- Has no support for `Sublime Text 2/3`, `Atom`, etc.
- Can't grab informations, such as impact factor of journal, citations of papers, etc.
- Poorly interface customization.
- Can't search within the full text of the `.pdf` files.
- Syntax analysis of `BibTeX` from Elsevier is wrong.
- ...

So, `Qiqi Reference` learns a lot from `JabRef`, and it will be more perfect.
